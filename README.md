Write-Wall
==========

A Chrome extension very similar to "Write Space", Write Wall goes a step further and syncs text with the logged-in Google Account
Write Wall was created to simply be able to share text content across multiple computers running under the same Chrome account. It's a simple concept with a simple solution: create an extension that allows users to paste whatever content and access it from any computer running Chrome.

I hope you find it as useful as I have and please feel free to fork this project on Github and/or provide suggestions for improving Write Wall.
