# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately if possible. Use GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting (Security tab) if it is enabled for this repository.

If private reporting is not available, open a GitHub issue and avoid including
sensitive details. A maintainer will follow up to move the discussion to a
private channel.

## Response Expectations

- We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days.
- We will work with you to validate and address the issue.
- Please allow time to investigate and release a fix before public disclosure.
